Tribe is a decentralized community platform which brings the independent content creators and their fans on a single platform. t. The platform introduces innovative features such as community funds control, cashback management, and community-driven decision-making to enhance discoverability, encourage community interaction, and ensure a fair and transparent allocation of funds. For funds control, we've introduced voting system within the community of the creator to ensure controlled and accounted flow of funds. Milestones are set for creators that will motivate them to engage and grow their community. For improving the discoverability and engagement, there are discussion groups for creators and their community wherein they can interact with each other via chats and live video calls and streams.

How it's Made
Tribe is a decentralized community platform that is built on top of the Polygon chain. Here the smart contract is written using Solidity language. We have used Tableland for storing all the social media and accounts-related data. We have used Push protocol for sending Notifications, providing Group Chats and Personal Chats and also Video Calls. Thanks to the magical Push Protocol tech. We have also used ENS's Domain Name and Avatar resolution. We have also implemented Random number generation using Drand which is used to pick a random lucky winner among the community and an exclusive NFT is transfered to them. This acts as a give away system. We have also used IPFS and Web3.storage for minting and creating NFTs which are given to the user when they subscribe to a creator.
